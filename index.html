        <h2><b>Road-Rash History</b></h2>
        <p>Road Rash is a pioneering motorcycle racing game series developed by Electronic Arts (EA), 
            first released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis. The game quickly gained popularity for its unique combination 
            of high-speed motorcycle racing and combat, where players could use weapons like chains and clubs to knock
             rivals off their bikes. The success of the original game led to a series of sequels and ports to various platforms,
              including the Sega Master System, Game Boy, PlayStation, and Microsoft Windows. Each installment introduced new features, 
              such as improved graphics, additional weapons, and more diverse tracks. Road Rash became a staple of 1990s gaming culture,
               praised for its innovative gameplay and engaging multiplayer mode. Despite its initial success, the series saw a decline in 
               the early 2000s, with the last major release, Road Rash: Jailbreak, coming out in 2000. However, Road Rash remains a beloved
                classic, often remembered for its thrilling gameplay and the nostalgic joy it brought to many gamers.</p>

        <h2><b>Testimonials</b></h2>
        <div ><p>Enjoyment. The good old days. I don’t care about the graphics of the game. Although I have to say that races were on a straight road always, which was kinda odd. But for a simple game which wasn’t meant to be serious and was supposed to let players have fun in terms of kicking other racers or belting them with chains, bare fists or bats, it’s golden. I remember me and my friends using some sort of ‘cheat codes’ to get nitro for the bike. ^_^

            Nevertheless, the game has a lot of memories attached to it. We don’t play such games anymore. Believe it or not, your question made me recollect those days all over again. Thanks.</p>
